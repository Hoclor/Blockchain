# Blockchain: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple
Code for the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies coursework for the `Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies` submodule as part of the `Contemporary Computer Science IV` module, taken in my fourth year of Computer Science (MEng) at Durham University.

In this assignment I investigated and interacted with the Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies (via testnets), and investigated and compared Ripple to Bitcoin in a 2-page report.
