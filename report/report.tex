		\label{table_mining_puzzles_pow}
	\end{table}

	\noindent The equations used for calculating the mining time estimates $t$ are as follows:
	
	\begin{equation}
	target = \frac{target_{initial}}{difficulty}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	h_q = \frac{h_{space}}{target}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	t = h_q * t_h
	\end{equation}
	
	Where $h_q$ is the estimated number of hashes required to be performed to find a valid hash, $target$ is the target value, $t_h$ is the estimated time per hash calculated by timing how long it takes to perform a large number of hashes (e.g. $10^9$) and finding the average. $t_h$ was computed as $1.365*10^{-5}$ and used for both calculations.
	
	For difficulty of $1$:
	
	$$target = \frac{00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000}{1}$$
	
	$$h_q = \frac{2^{256}}{00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000} = 4295032833$$
	
	$$t = 4295032833 * 1.365*10^{-5} = 58629$$
	
	For difficulty of $7454968648263$:
	
	$$target = \frac{00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000}{7454968648263} = 3.62*10^{54}$$
	
	$$h_q = \frac{2^{256}}{3.62*10^{54}} = 3.2 * 10^{22}$$
	
	$$t = 3.2 * 10^{22} * 1.365*10^{-5} = 4.37*10^{17}$$
	
	\subsection{Proof of Stake}
	
	The requested information for Proof of Stake is as follows:

		\caption{Mining Puzzles Information}
		\label{table_mining_puzzles_pos}
	\end{table}
	
	\noindent The equations used for calculating the hit value are as follows:
	
	\begin{equation}
	hit_{full} = hash(sign(S_g))
	\end{equation}
	
	Where the hit value is the first 8 bytes of $hit_{full}$, and $S_g$ is the generation signature for the previous block:
	
	$$S_g = 9737957703d4eb54efdff91e15343266123c5f15aaf033292c9903015af817f1$$
	
	$$sign(S_g) = aa2974089248c51977f63350c3aad2757b935d68a236dd777621c3ed879657d2c5e1f01d22ad16bb2d37f1c2567d1daeccd4e3f1a45201f53291e2eba9e9bea3$$
	
	$$hash(sign(S_g))[:8] = a135a0781dd3c0f6$$
	
	\noindent The time in seconds when you would be able to forge a new block was calculated using the following equations:
	
	\begin{equation}
	T = T_b * B_e
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	t_{forge} = \frac{hit}{T}
	\end{equation}
	
	Where $T$ is the target value (independent of time passed), $T_b$ is the base target value, $B_e$ is your effective balance, and $t_{forge}$ is the time when you can forge a new block (rounded up, in seconds):
	
	$$T = 1229782938247303 * 24 = 29514790517935272$$
	
	$$t_{forge} = \frac{11616367251628998902}{29514790517935272} = 394$$

			&Explanation of hex script&This script is equivalent to `OP\_RETURN 06 7062716b323'. This causes the transaction to always be marked invalid, as OP\_RETURN always outputs \emph{fail}. The `06' signals that the next 6 bytes are to be pushed onto the stack, and `7062716b323' is the result of converting `pbqk24', my USER ID, from ASCII to hex.\\

			\hline
			&Inferences from structure&This is a transaction claiming the mining reward of (at the time) $\sim12.6$BTC (including transaction fees). This can be inferred as there is no input script, thus this transaction is the miner's claiming their reward.\\

			\hline
			&Input scripts&There is a single input script, which includes a witness.\\
			\hline
			&Output scripts&There are a large number of output scripts, most simply checking the hash of the receiver's address is valid, and a few additionally verifying and checking the signature.\\
			\hline
			&Inferences from structure&As this transaction has a single input, multiple outputs, and pays a large sum ($\sim1.7$ BTC), I suspect that this is payout from a mining guild, or possibly a sale of bitcoin by an exchange.\\

			\hline
			 &Input scripts&This transaction contains a large number of input scripts. Most of these have a small input amount, with three being notably large: $\sim1, \sim4.3,$ and $\sim25$ bitcoin. All input scripts are from the same address.\\
			\hline
			 &Output scripts&The transaction contains two output scripts. One claims $\sim13.2$ BTC, and the other $22.5$ BTC.\\
			\hline
			 &Inferences from structure&Due to the amounts involved, and the exact payment of $22.5$ BTC to the second output address, I suspect that this transaction is a user selling BTC to an exchange. This is supported by investigating the recipient address of the $22.5$ BTC, which shows it being involved in numerous high-value transactions, where the address seems to mainly be used as a middle man, often transferring the exact input amount onwards to another address.\\

	\section{Investment Advice: Bitcoin, NXT or Gold}
	
	The judgment of what to invest in depends on your reasons for investing. Firstly, if you are investing to maintain value then gold would be the best candidate. The value of gold rarely fluctuates, and it has some value as a material outside of being used as currency. It is also the most durable of these options, as it is not reliant on any technology or network in order to have worth and be useable. Even in extreme circumstances such as financial collapse, gold will maintain value as a currency, while any cryptocurrency may see its value plummet or become invalid due to collapse of its network or userbase.
	
	If you are investing to make short-term returns, then NXT is likely the best candidate. Over the past few months both Bitcoin and NXT have started to increase in value. Out of these two NXT has risen faster, and due to its technical advantages over Bitcoin, such as using Proof of Stake rather than Proof of Work making it less wasteful to operate and more expensive to attack, and its ability to trade any asset on its network, it has more utility than Bitcoin. This theoretically gives NXT an edge over Bitcoin, meaning it should steal market share and users from it over time. However, this is not necessarily going to happen due to the popularity of Bitcoin. Even though Bitcoin is an inefficient and outdated cryptocurrency, the fact that it was the first coin to gain widespread popularity and support cannot be ignored. It currently holds the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, and is unlikely to lose popularity quickly.
	
	Additionally, there is a large number of cryptocurrencies available, most of which have at least some technical merits over Bitcoin, meaning NXT is competing with these as well as Bitcoin in the attempt to gain market share and value. This means it is is extremely unlikely for NXT to become a true Bitcoin equal, and its value is likely to stay volatile. This means that investing in NXT could see short-term profits, but these are unlikely to be large or sustainable.
	
	The popularity of Bitcoin may also be a detriment when it comes to investment, however. Due to its technical shortcomings, Bitcoin is only capable of processing a handful of transactions per second, with long delays before a transaction is confirmed. This means that the more popular the cryptocurrency becomes, the more expensive transactions will become due to fees needed to ensure the transaction is confirmed within a reasonable time period. This will likely cap the potential market cap and value of Bitcoin in the future, which limits the investment opportunities in it. Even worse, this effect may result in people becoming aware of its technical shortcomings, and moving to other cryptocurrencies, leading to a massive crash in users, market cap, and value.
	
	Because of the reasons outlined above, I would recommend investing in NXT, as it has the largest potential to yield returns on the investment in the long-term.
